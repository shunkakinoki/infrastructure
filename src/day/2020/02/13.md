## SUMMARY

> "Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise."
>
> - Kobe Bryant

Although it is an opportunity, I must say that I haven't been able to capitalize.
I haven't been able to capitalize on the following.

- Social Network with `Exposure`
- The Ability to Proactively Connect With Different People
- The `GRIT`, the Ability to Complete Work

If I can't complete the `300 Pitches`, I will have no reason to be on this planet.
Seriously.
This is what I want to do.
Don't waste the opportunity.
`JUST DO IT`

## THIS WEEK'S QUOTE
